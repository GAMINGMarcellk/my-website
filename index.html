                    <p>
                        I'm a half-stack developer based in the United States.
                        I'm passionate about building all types of applications and learning new technologies,
                        frameworks, and languages.
                        I'm currently working as a freelancer and I'm always, looking for new opportunities to learn and
                        grow.
                        I'm also a student and completely self-taught, so I'm planning to study a full-stack development
                        course in the near future.
                        I'm currently working on getting better at designing and building websites and applications.

                <p>
                    I'm very interested in video games and I love playing them with my friends and I'm always
                    looking for new games to play.
                    I'm also a big fan of movies very specifically comedy and sci-fi movies.
                    I listen to a lot of indie and rock music and I'm always looking for new music to listen to.
                    I also have a favorite hobby which would be swimming and I love to swim around for hours on end.
                    I spend most of my time watching youtube videos and I'm in love with the amount of content that
                    is available to me.
