                <h1>Hi, I'm Glock</h1>
                <p>
                    I'm a half-stack developer based in the United States.
                    I'm passionate about building all types of applications and learning new technologies, frameworks, and languages.
                    I'm currently working as a freelancer and I'm always, looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.
                    I'm also a student and completely self-taught, so I'm planning to study a full-stack development course in the near future.
                    I'm working on my portfolio and resume to show you what I can do at the moment.

                    <p>
                        I'm very interested in video games and I love playing them with my friends and I'm always looking for new games to play.
                        I'm also a big fan of movies very specifically comedy and sci-fi movies, I'm also a big fan of music and I'm always looking for new music to listen to.
                        I listen to a lot of indie and rock music and I'm always looking for new music to listen to.
                        Other than that another one of my last and favorite hobbies is definitely swimming.
                        I spend most of my time watching youtube videos and I'm in love with the amount of content that is available to me.
